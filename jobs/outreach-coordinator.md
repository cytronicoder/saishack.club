# Outreach and Partnerships Coordinator

The success of our upcoming events isn’t just about what happens on the day—it’s about what we have laid beforehand. We need someone who can turn ideas into reality by connecting us with the right people and resources. Your role is essential for transforming our events from good to great and for setting us up for continued growth. By securing strategic partnerships now, you’ll be ensuring that the SAIS Hack Club has the backing and recognition it needs to keep pushing boundaries and expanding our impact in the Stamford community.

**What you’ll do:** You’ll be the powerhouse behind the connections that will make our upcoming events and workshops unforgettable. Whether it’s securing sponsorships that allow us to level up our hackathons or partnering with top tech companies to bring in industry experts, you’ll ensure that every event has the resources and visibility it needs to succeed. And it’s not just about the immediate future—you’ll be building relationships that will open doors for future collaborations, internships, and opportunities that our members haven’t even dreamed of yet.

**Who we’re looking for:** You’re someone who sees opportunities everywhere and knows how to capitalize on them. You’re driven, persuasive, and ready to make things happen. If you’re excited about playing a key role in the future of the SAIS Hack Club by building the relationships that matter, we’re looking for you.
