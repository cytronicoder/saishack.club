# Content and Social Media Manager

Hack Club's growing fast, and we need someone who can help us stay ahead of the curve. We’ve got some major events on the horizon, and we need someone who can amplify the hype. You are critical for creating that pre-event hype and keeping the conversation alive afterward. Whether it’s rallying our members or catching the eye of potential partners and sponsors, your content will be the driving force behind our success. In the long run, your work will help position the SAIS Hack Club as a go-to destination for students interested in tech at Stamford.

**What you’ll do:** You’ll be at the heart of our digital presence, driving the creation and distribution of killer content that gets people talking about the SAIS Hack Club. You’ll be the go-to person for all things content, from Instagram stories to newsletters. Your work will set the stage for every event we host, making sure that when we go live, the community is already fired up. And beyond events, you’ll be laying the foundation for future opportunities—building a content legacy that keeps the momentum going long after the last workshop wraps up.

**Who we’re looking for:** You’re a content creator with a passion for making things happen. You understand that great content isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about impact. You’re ready to take on the challenge of making our events and workshops not just events, but experiences that everyone wants to be a part of.
